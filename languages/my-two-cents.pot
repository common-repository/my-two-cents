"When enabled, this will schedule a once-per-hour poll of your BitCoin "

"than the default method because you will occasionally re-use one of your "
"receive addresses multiple times but, unlike the default method that uses "
"automatically generated forwarding addresses, there is no middle-man. "
"Enabling this option also adds a field to your comment form asking your "
"commenters for their BTC sending address. Even if you enable this option, "
"commenters who do not supply a sending address with their comment will still "
"be prompted to use the default automatically generated address method as a "
"fallback."
